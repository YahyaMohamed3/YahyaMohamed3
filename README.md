# Welcome to My GitHub! üëã

## üí´ About Me
Hello! I'm a second-year college student with a strong interest in **Software Engineering**, especially in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. I have hands-on experience in developing systems for clinic platforms, and now high-frequency trading simulations.

### Education & Background
I have completed several Harvard courses, including **CS50x**, **CS50W**, and **CS50 AI**, which strengthened my foundation in computer science and artificial intelligence. These courses, along with my personal projects and ongoing research, have given me a deep appreciation for the challenges and dedication involved in building reliable software solutions.

## üíº Current Projects
- **High-Frequency Trading Simulation with RL**: Developing a distributed system that leverages **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. This project focuses on **order matching**, **latency optimization**, and integrating **RL algorithms** like Q-Learning, DQN, PPO, and MARL.  
  üîó [HFT Simulation with MARL](https://github.com/YahyaMohamed3/HFT-MARL)

- **UltraBook ‚Äì High-Performance Market Microstructure Simulator**: A blazing-fast C++17 order book and matching engine capable of millions of orders/second with microsecond latencies. Includes a full **benchmark suite**, **stress testing framework**, and performance profiling for advanced market microstructure research.  
  üîó [UltraBook](https://github.com/YahyaMohamed3/UltraBook)

- **MediFlow**: A healthcare management system built as a comprehensive platform for clinics and patient support.  
  üîó [MediFlow](https://github.com/YahyaMohamed3/MediFlow)

- **DermaSense ‚Äì Skin Cancer Detection Platform (World‚Äôs Largest Hackathon)**: Built and trained two SOTA models to identify **14 skin conditions** (including 7 cancers/precancerous lesions). Achieved **97% top-2 accuracy** on clinical images using TensorFlow. Deployed as a full-stack platform with **FastAPI backend (Google Cloud)**, **React/TypeScript frontend (Netlify)**, **Supabase for auth**, and **JWT-secured lesion tracking with RAG**.

- **Brand Style AI (Adobe 2025 Hackathon)**: A design-intelligence add-on that extracts **brand DNA** (colors, fonts, palettes) from logos/websites and generates editable Adobe Express templates. Built with **FastAPI**, **Supabase**, and **React/TypeScript**, with a strong focus on UX, automation, and hackathon-compliant deployment.

## üîç Research
I'm actively involved in **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) research** at my college, where I‚Äôm focused on how MARL can be applied to financial markets and trading simulations. This research aims to enhance my skills in **Distributed Systems** and **High-Frequency Trading**.

## üîß Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/c++, SQL ( currenlty learning java)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React , Django, Flask, Bootstrap, Socket.io, Fast-api, Spring-boot
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, REST APIs, Client-Server Architecture
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Reinforcement Learning (RL), Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Q-Learning, DQN, PPO, Computer Vision m Transsfer Learning
- **CS50 AI**: Search Algorithms, Optimization, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation
- **CS50 Web**: Django, SQL, Authentication, JavaScript (ES6+), Frontend & Backend Integration
- **CS50x Topics**: C Programming, Data Structures, Memory Management, Algorithms (Sorting, Searching), Problem-Solving

## üöÄ Goals
My goal is to advance my understanding of AI/ML and secure an internship in tech. Currently, I‚Äôm exploring **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** for trading and working toward proficiency in **Distributed Systems** and **HFT**.
